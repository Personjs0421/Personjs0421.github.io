  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, my name is Julian Soong and I go by personjs online. I have played under Intel Chips and carbonara, my Capture-The-Flag (CTF) teams.
    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, cubing, and of course, coding and CTFs.
    I have been programming since I was in primary school and have been playing in CTFs since 2024.
  </p>
  <p>
    My programming journey has been very enjoyable so far, going from thinking that "high-level language" meant "difficult to learn" to earning myself an olympiad medal.
    My cybersecurity journey has been similar, from trying to open an ELF file on a Windows machine... in notepad... to being one of the top CTF players in the country in my age group.
  </p>

            <p>Unexpected but welcome surprise</p>
            <p class="desc">
              After a shaky performance in the YCEP bootcamp and barely making the cut for the Central Capture The Flag (CCTF)
              competition, I managed to achieve my highest placing at the time, 4th place individual at the CCTF 2024.
              Achieving 4th place only 6 months after learning about CTFs showed me my potential and pushed my on my
              journey to become better.

            <p>First time qualifying for physical finals of an online contest</p>
            <p class="desc">
              While I technically participated in a team of 4, due to their circumstances the other 3 were only able to
              score around 2% of our total points, so I hacked away for almost a day straight and managed to qualify for
              the finals as the only secondary school team (to my knowledge). It was definitely a challenge playing essentially
              solo as a secondary schooler against teams of JC and polytechnic students, but it was a fun experience nonetheless
               (and I'm happy I even qualified honestly).

            <p class="desc">
              Similar to that year's BlahajCTF, I technically participated in a team of 3, but the other two were not able
              to help out in the qualifiers or finals. In the end, I went to the physical finals alone and managed to get
              10th place, which was an improvement over my 11th place in the qualifiers.

            <p class="desc">
              Initially, I didn't really want to compete in the National Olympiad of Informatics (NOI),
              but after some contemplation I figured it would be worth a try. After my end-of-year examinations in 2024,
              I dedicated my time to learning C++, which was a new(ish) language for me, as well tons of algorithms and problem-solving skills.
              In the end, I managed to claim a satisfactory silver medal after 3-4 months of preparation. I'm aiming for a gold medal in 2026!

              Following my 4th place placing in 2024, I wanted to do better in 2025. Although I was
              gunning for 1st but placed 3rd, I did manage to place higher than the last year, so I suppose all is well.

            <p class="desc">
              I was pretty nervous and not very confident going into the National Cybersecurity Olympiad (NCO),
              competing against JC students with more experience, especially since it was in an individual competition.
              However, I somehow managed to pull through with a gold medal and 6th place overall, allowing me to compete
              in the inaugural International Cybersecurity Olympiad in late June.
